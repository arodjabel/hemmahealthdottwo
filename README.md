We are go, check us out!

I have committed everything for this site except for some server js stuff that I am using to handle and validate the recaptcha and contact us requests.
It has keys and emails that we do not really want public, you know?

I am using AWS elastic beanstalk to deploy this website. Using the app.js and package.json, elastic beanstalk will use Node to deploy the site.
