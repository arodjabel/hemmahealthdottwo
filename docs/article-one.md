# AHRQ (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) recently updated their website to provide guidance on warm hand-offs.

#### A warm handoff is a transfer of care from one clinician to another, where the handoff occurs in front of the patient and family. The best resource I found was the [Design Guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arodjabel/hemmahealthdottwo/master/docs/design-guide-warm-handoff.pdf) for Implementing Warm Hand-offs. While the guide may seem quick and practical, in an ever-busy clinic environment, this transition gets overlooked. (Ever see a provider chase their nurse to ask if the patient is ready to be seen?) I'm also not used to seeing the hand-off occur in front of the patient. How does your clinic handle this?
